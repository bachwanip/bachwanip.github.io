This Python code the N50 value, number of contigs, total length of contigs and the length of the largest contig from a FASTA file using BIOPYTHON SEQIOMODULE.
Save your python file and FASTA file in the same folder.
The code will ask the user to input the name of the FASTA file.


To check if BIOPYTHON is installed:
Type "python"
Type "import bio" and enter 

If you don't have it installed, you can install it using this command: 
#pip install biopython
#pip3 install biopyton







from Bio import SeqIO
def cal_N50(filename):
    lengths = []
    for record in SeqIO.parse(filename, 'fasta'):
        lengths.append(len(record))
    lengths.sort(reverse=True)
    total_length = sum(lengths)
    running_total = 0
    for length in lengths:
        running_total += length
        if running_total >= total_length / 2:
            n50 = length
            break
    return n50, lengths, total_length
filename = input("FASTA file: ")
n50_value, lengths, total_length = cal_N50(filename)
num_contigs = len(lengths)
max_contig_length = max(lengths)
with open("report.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Number of contigs: {}\n".format(num_contigs))
    f.write("Total length of contigs: {}\n".format(total_length))
    f.write("Length of largest contig: {}\n".format(max_contig_length))
    f.write("N50 value: {}\n".format(n50_value))
